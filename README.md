##CA2 VIRUS SIMULATOR
-For CA2 I have created a simulator that represents the effect of covid-19 in the Dundalk - Carlingford area.

-Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
-Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.

-The area currently has 18 confirmed cases with a total population of 25,599.
-This means that 1 in 1422 is infected.
-Loading 55 molecules on my canvas means 1 in 28 of the group is infected.

-for the purpose of the CA the chance of catching the virus is 50/50
